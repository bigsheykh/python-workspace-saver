(gh pr 1342)\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Made all ``dateutil`` submodules lazily imported using `PEP 562\n  <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0562/>`_. On Python 3.7+, things like\n  ``import dateutil; dateutil.tz.gettz(\"America/New_York\")`` will now work\n  without explicitly importing ``dateutil.tz``, with the import occurring behind\n  the scenes on first use. The old behavior remains on Python 3.6 and earlier.\n  Fixed by Orson Adams. (gh issue 771, gh pr 1007)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- Removed a call to ``datetime.utcfromtimestamp``, which is deprecated as of Python 3.12. Reported by Hugo van Kemenade (gh pr 1284), fixed by Thomas Grainger (gh pr 1285).\n\n\nDocumentation changes\n---------------------\n\n- Added note into docs and tests where relativedelta would return last day of the month\n  only if the same day on a different month resolves to a date that doesn't exist.\n  Reported by hawkEye-01 (gh issue 1167). Fixed by Mifrill (gh pr 1168)\n\n\n", "2.8.2": "==========================\n\nData updates\n------------\n\n- Updated tzdata version to 2021a. (gh pr 1128)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- Fixed a bug in the parser where non-``ValueError`` exceptions would be raised\n  during exception handling; this would happen, for example, if an\n  ``IllegalMonthError`` was raised in ``dateutil`` code. Fixed by Mark Bailey.\n  (gh issue 981, pr 987).\n- Fixed the custom ``repr`` for ``dateutil.parser.ParserError``, which was not\n  defined due to an indentation error. (gh issue 991, gh pr 993)\n- Fixed a bug that caused ``b'`` prefixes to appear in parse_isodate exception\n  messages. Reported and fixed by Paul Brown (pawl) (gh pr 1122)\n- Make ``isoparse`` raise when trying to parse times with inconsistent use of\n  `:` separator. Reported and fixed by mariocj89 (gh pr 1125).\n- Fixed ``tz.gettz()`` not returning local time when passed an empty string.\n  Reported by labrys (gh issues 925, 926). Fixed by ffe4 (gh pr 1024)\n\n\nDocumentation changes\n---------------------\n\n- Rearranged parser documentation into \"Functions\", \"Classes\" and \"Warnings and\n  Exceptions\" categories. (gh issue 992, pr 994).\n- Updated ``parser.parse`` documentation to reflect the switch from\n  ``ValueError`` to ``ParserError``. (gh issue 992, pr 994).\n- Fixed methods in the ``rrule`` module not being displayed in the docs. (gh pr\n  1025)\n- Changed some relative links in the exercise documentation to refer to the\n  document locations in the input tree, rather than the generated HTML files in\n  the HTML output tree (which presumably will not exist in non-HTML output\n  formats). (gh pr 1078).\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- Moved ``test_imports.py``, ``test_internals.py`` and ``test_utils.py`` to\n  pytest.  Reported and fixed by jpurviance (gh pr 978)\n- Added project_urls for documentation and source. Patch by andriyor (gh pr\n  975).\n- Simplified handling of bytes and bytearray in ``_parser._timelex``. Reported\n  and fixed by frenzymadness (gh issue 1060).\n- Changed the tests against the upstream tz database to always generate fat\n  binaries, since until GH-590 and GH-1059 are resolved, \"slim\" zic binaries\n  will cause problems in many zones, causing the tests to fail. This also\n  updates ``zoneinfo.rebuild`` to always generate fat binaries. (gh pr 1076).\n- Moved sdist and wheel generation to use `python-build`.

Reported by kainjow (gh issue 901).\n- Parsing errors will now raise ``ParserError``, a subclass of ``ValueError``,\n  which has a nicer string representation. Patch by gfyoung (gh pr 881).\n- ``parser.parse`` will now raise ``TypeError`` when ``tzinfos`` is passed a\n  type that cannot be interpreted as a time zone.

Reported and fixed by labrys () (gh issue\n  927, gh pr 935).\n- Changed compatibility logic to support a potential Python 4.0 release. Patch\n  by Hugo van Kemenade (gh pr 950).\n- Updated many modules to use ``tz.UTC`` in favor of ``tz.tzutc()`` internally,\n  to avoid an unnecessary function call. (gh pr 910).\n- Fixed issue where ``dateutil.tz`` was using a backported version of\n  ``contextlib.nullcontext`` even in Python 3.7 due to a malformed import\n  statement. (gh pr 963).\n\n\nTests\n-----\n\n- Switched from using assertWarns to using pytest.warns in the test suite. (gh\n  pr 969).\n- Fix typo in setup.cfg causing PendingDeprecationWarning to not be explicitly\n  specified as an error in the warnings filter. (gh pr 966)\n- Fixed issue where ``test_tzlocal_offset_equal`` would fail in certain\n  environments (such as FreeBSD) due to an invalid assumption about what time\n  zone names are provided. Reported and fixed by Kubilay Kocak (gh issue 918,\n  pr 928).\n- Fixed a minor bug in ``test_isoparser`` related to ``bytes``/``str``\n  handling.

Patch by Hugo van Kemenade (gh pr 952).\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- Added Python 3.8 to the trove classifiers. (gh pr 970)\n- Moved as many keys from ``setup.py`` to ``setup.cfg`` as possible.  Fixed by\n  FakeNameSE, aquinlan82, jachen20, and gurgenz221 (gh issue 871, gh pr\n  880).\n- Reorganized ``parser`` methods by functionality. Patch by jbrockmendel (gh\n  pr 882).\n- Switched ``release.py`` over to using ``pep517.build`` for creating releases,\n  rather than direct invocations of ``setup.py``. Fixed by smeng10 (gh issue\n  869, gh pr 875).\n- Added a \"build\" environment into the tox configuration, to handle dependency\n  management when making releases.

This cache-expiry behavior is not\n  guaranteed in the public interface and may change in the future. To improve\n  performance in the case where transient references to the same time zones\n  are repeatedly created but no strong reference is continuously held, a\n  smaller \"strong value\" cache was also added.

Ambiguous dates and times can now\n  be safely represented by all dateutil time zones. Many thanks to Alexander\n  Belopolski (abalkin) and Tim Peters tim-one for their inputs on how to\n  address this. Original issues reported by Yupeng and zed (lP: 1390262,\n  gh issues 57, 112, 249, 284, 286, prs 127, 225, 248, 264, 302).\n- Added new methods for working with ambiguous and imaginary dates to the tz\n  module. datetime_ambiguous() determines if a datetime is ambiguous for a given\n  zone and datetime_exists() determines if a datetime exists in a given zone.\n  This works for all fold-aware datetimes, not just those provided by dateutil.\n  (gh issue 253, gh pr 302)\n- Fixed an issue where dst() in Portugal in 1996 was returning the wrong value\n  in tz.tzfile objects. Reported by abalkin (gh issue 128, pr 225)\n- Fixed an issue where zoneinfo.ZoneInfoFile errors were not being properly\n  deep-copied. (gh issue 226, pr 225)\n- Refactored tzwin and tzrange as a subclass of a common class, tzrangebase, as\n  there was substantial overlapping functionality. As part of this change,\n  tzrange and tzstr now expose a transitions() function, which returns the\n  DST on and off transitions for a given year. (gh issue 260, pr 302)\n- Deprecated zoneinfo.gettz() due to confusion with tz.gettz(), in favor of\n  get() method of zoneinfo.ZoneInfoFile objects.

(gh issues 171, 269, pr 247)\n- Fixed an issue where tzfile objects were not properly handling dst() and\n  tzname() when attached to datetime.time objects. Reported by ovacephaloid.\n  (gh issue 292, pr 309)\n- /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo was added to TZPATHS for compatibility with Solaris\n  systems. Reported by dhduvall (gh issue 276, pr 307)\n- tzoffset and tzrange objects now accept either a number of seconds or a\n  datetime.timedelta() object wherever previously only a number of seconds was\n  allowed. (gh pr 264, 277)\n- datetime.timedelta objects can now be added to relativedelta objects. Reported\n  and added by Alec Nikolas Reiter (justanr) (gh issue 282, pr 283\n- Refactored relativedelta.weekday and rrule.weekday into a common base class\n  to reduce code duplication. (gh issue 140, pr 311)\n- An issue where the WKST parameter was improperly rendering in str(rrule) was\n  reported and fixed by Daniel LePage (dplepage). (gh issue 262, pr 263)\n- A replace() method has been added to rrule objects by jendas1, which creates\n  new rrule with modified attributes, analogous to datetime.replace (gh pr 167)\n- Made some significant performance improvements to rrule objects in Python 2.x\n  (gh pr 245)\n- All classes defining equality functions now return NotImplemented when\n  compared to unsupported classes, rather than raising TypeError, to allow other\n  classes to provide fallback support. (gh pr 236)\n- Several classes have been marked as explicitly unhashable to maintain\n  identical behavior between Python 2 and 3. Submitted by Roy Williams\n  (rowillia) (gh pr 296)\n- Trailing whitespace in easter.py has been removed. Submitted by OmgImAlexis\n  (gh pr 299)\n- Windows-only batch files in build scripts had line endings switched to CRLF.\n  (gh pr 237)\n- adamchainz updated the documentation links to reflect that the canonical\n  location for readthedocs links is now at .io, not .org. (gh pr 272)\n- Made some changes to the CI and codecov to test against newer versions of\n  Python and pypy, and to adjust the code coverage requirements. For the moment,\n  full pypy3 compatibility is not supported until a new release is available,\n  due to upstream bugs in the old version affecting PEP-495 support.\n  (gh prs 265, 266, 304, 308)\n- The full PGP signing key fingerprint was added to the README.md in favor of\n  the previously used long-id.
