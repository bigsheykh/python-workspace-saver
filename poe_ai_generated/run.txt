# Can you create a Python file that doesn't have inputs and only has outputs?
# Additionally, can it be longer than 50 lines?
# Also, can it have imports and use those imports?
# Also, can it use PyUnicode_EncodeUTF8 function?


# This is an example Python file with outputs, imports, and the PyUnicode_EncodeUTF8 function
